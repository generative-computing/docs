Before we get started, you will need to download and install [ollama](https://ollama.com/). Mellea can work with many different types of backends, but everything in this tutorial will "just work" on a Macbook running IBM's Granite 3.3 8B model.

We also recommend that you download and install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation)

Once you have ollama installed and running, we can get started with our first generative piece of code:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import mellea

# WARNING: this line will download IBM's Granite 3.3 8B model.

m = mellea.start_session()

email = m.instruct(
"Write an email inviting interns to an office party at 3:30pm.")
print(email.value)

```

</CodeGroup>

You can run this program using uv:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Bash
uv run docs/examples/tutorial/example_1.py
```

</CodeGroup>

We initialized a backend running Ollama on a local machine using the granite3.3-chat model.
We then ask the model to generate an email and print it to the console.

> [!NOTE]
> Mellea supports many other models and backends. By default, a new Mellea session will run IBM's capable Granite 8B model on your own laptop. This is a good (and free!) way to get started. If you would like to try out other models or backends, you can explicitly specify the backend and model in the start_session method. For example, `mellea.start_session(backend_name="ollama", model_id=mellea.model_ids.IBM_GRANITE_3_3_8B)`.

Before continuing, let's wrap this call into a function with some arguments:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import mellea

def write_email(m: mellea.MelleaSession, name: str, notes: str) -> str:
email = m.instruct(
"Write an email to {{name}} using the notes following: {{notes}}.",
user_dict={"name": name, "notes": notes},
)
return email.value # str(email) also works.

m = mellea.start_session()
print(write_email(m, "Olivia",
"Olivia helped the lab over the last few weeks by organizing intern events, advertising the speaker series, and handling issues with snack delivery."))

```

</CodeGroup>

Viola, we now have an email-writing function!

Notice how the instruct method can take a dictionary of variables as `user_dict`. These are filled by treating the instruction description as a jinja template.
