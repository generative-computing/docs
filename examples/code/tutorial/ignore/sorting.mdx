"""This file demonstrates how to sort a natural language string in a "verbalized algorithm" style.

Verbalized algorithms is a style of algorithms that uses LLM to perform
high-level reasoning tasks such as sorting, clustering, etc.
Given an informal representation of a formal task,
it operates by replacing some basic atomic operations in a classical algorithm
with a LLM-driven text-based one while retaining the high-level control flow,
thereby largely retaining the theoretical guarantees of the original algorithm.

Imagine receiving hundreds of customer complaints and one must quickly
sort and select 5 customers who most urgently need supports.
Feeding such a large set of input strings blindly into an LLM is ineffective and impractical
both due to the limited context length and its limited ability to perform sorting task
--- LLMs provide no guarantees on the correctness of their outputs for a computational reasoning task such as sorting,
other than anecdotal, empirical observations that they sometimes do.

In contrast, traditional disciplines of computer science approach this task
using algorithms that involve task decomposition.
For example, a merge sort decomposes the entire sorting task into several sorting tasks over individual sublists
and combines the results, where at the limit, there is an elementary binary comparison operator that is applied to
individual pair of objects in the list.
