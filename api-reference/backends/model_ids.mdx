# Module: `model_ids`

Utilities for model identifiers.

## Classes

### `class ModelIdentifier`

The `ModelIdentifier` class wraps around model identification strings.

Using model strings is messy:
1. Different platforms use variations on model id strings.
2. Using raw strings is annoying because: no autocomplete, typos, hallucinated names, mismatched model and tokenizer names, etc.
