# Module: `sampling`

sampling methods go here.

## Classes

### `class SamplingResult`

Stores the results from a sampling operation. This includes successful and failed samplings.

#### Methods

##### `__init__(self, result, success)`

Initialize a new instance of sampling results.

Args:
result: The final output or result from applying the sampling strategy.
success: A boolean indicating whether the operation was successful.
sample_generations: A list containing intermediate generations produced during the process.
sample_validations: For each generation a list of a requirement and a boolean value indicating whether the requirement was met.

### `class SamplingStrategy`

A SamplingStrategy class defines an abstract base class for implementing various sampling strategies.

This class provides a template for creating concrete sampling strategies that can be used to generate model outputs based on given instructions.
It allows setting custom validation and generation functions through properties.

#### Methods

##### `sample(self, instruction)`

This method is the abstract method for sampling a given instruction.

It must be implemented by any concrete subclasses to provide specific sampling logic.

Args:
instruction (Instruction): The instruction object to be sampled.
generate_logs: Optional list of GenerateLog objects. If None, no collection happens.

-----

---

### `class RejectionSamplingStrategy`

Sampling strategy that rejects samples based on given instructions.

#### Methods

##### `__init__(self)`

Initialize a new instance of the class with default parameters.

Args:
loop_budget: Number of times to iterate through the process. Must be greater than 0.
repair: Function to apply "repairs" to an instruction based on its requirements and validation results.
select_from_failure: Function to select a model output thunk from failed attempts.
validate: Function to validate the results against requirements. If None, validation is provided later through setter.
generate: Function to generate new model output thunks. If None, generate is provided later through setter.
requirements: List of requirements to test against. If None, test all requirements attached to the given instruction.

Raises:
AssertionError: If loop_budget is not greater than 0.

-----

##### `sample(self, instruction)`

This method performs a sampling operation based on the given instruction.

Args:
instruction: The Instruction object containing the instruction to generate a valid model output thunk.
show_progress: if true, a tqdm progress bar is used. Otherwise messages will still be sent to flog.
generate_logs: If provided, the generations will be logged.

Returns:
SamplingResult: A result object indicating the success or failure of the sampling process.

Raises:
AssertionError: Asserts that all required components (repair, select_from_failure, validate, and generate) are provided before proceeding with the sampling.
