# `mellea.stdlib.mify`


Mify classes and objects.

## Functions

### `mify`

```python
mify(*args, **kwargs)
```


M-ify an object or class.

Allows the object (or instances of the class) to be used in m sessions and with m functions.

For the args below, only specify an _include or an _exclude of for fields and funcs. If both are specified,
include takes precedence. If you specify the same item to be included and excluded, nothing will be included.

If fields_include or fields_exclude are set:
- the stringify_func will not be used to represent this object to the model
- you must specify a template field or a template in the template_order field that handles a dict with those fields as keys
- it's advised to use fields_include due to the many dunder fields and inherited fields an object/class might have

Mify sets attributes on the object/class. If the object isn't already an mified/mobject, it will overwrite
the attributes and methods of the object/class necessary for it to be mified.

**Args:**
- `obj`: either a class or an instance of the class
- `fields_include`: fields of the object to include in its representation to models
- `fields_exclude`: fields of the object to exclude from its representation to models
- `funcs_include`: functions of the object to include in its representation to models
- `funcs_exclude`: functions of the object to exclude from its representation to models
- `query_type`: a specific query component type to use when querying a model
- `transform_type`: a specific transform component type to use when transforming with a model
- `template`: a string representation of a jinja template; takes precedence over template_order
- `template_order`: a template ordering to use when searching for applicable templates
- `parsing_func`: not yet implemented
- `stringify_func`: used to create a string representation of the object

**Returns:**
- An object if an object was passed in or a decorator (callable) to mify classes.
- If an object is returned, that object will be the same object that was passed in.
- For example,
- ```
- obj = mify(obj)
- obj.format_for_llm()
- ```
- and
- ```
- mify(obj)
- obj.format_for_llm()
- ```
- are equivalent.
- Most IDEs will not correctly show the type hints for the newly added functions
- for either an mify object or instances of an mified class. For IDE support, write
- ```
- assert isinstance(obj, MifiedProtocol)
- ```


## Classes

### `MifiedProtocol`


Adds additional functionality to the MObjectProtocol and modifies MObject functions so that mified objects can be more easily interacted with and modified.

See the mify decorator for more information.


**Methods:**

#### `parts`

```python
parts(self) -> list[Component | CBlock]
```

Returns a list of parts for MObject.

[no-index]


#### `get_query_object`

```python
get_query_object(self, query: str) -> Query
```

Returns the instantiated query object.

[no-index]

**Args:**
- `query `: The query string.


#### `get_transform_object`

```python
get_transform_object(self, transformation: str) -> Transform
```

Returns the instantiated transform object.

[no-index]

**Args:**
- `transformation`: the transform string


#### `content_as_string`

```python
content_as_string(self) -> str
```

Returns the content of the Mified object as a string.

[no-index]

Will use the passed in stringify function if provided.


#### `format_for_llm`

```python
format_for_llm(self) -> TemplateRepresentation
```

The representation of an object given to the backend.

[no-index]

Sets the TemplateRepresentation fields based on the object and the values
specified during mify.

See mify decorator for more details.
