# `mellea.stdlib.sampling.types`


Base types for sampling.

## Classes

### `SamplingResult`


Stores the results from a sampling operation. This includes successful and failed samplings.


**Methods:**

#### `result`

```python
result(self) -> ModelOutputThunk
```

The final output or result from applying the sampling strategy.


#### `result_ctx`

```python
result_ctx(self) -> Context
```

The context of the final output or result from applying the sampling strategy.


#### `result_action`

```python
result_action(self) -> Component
```

The action that generated the final output or result from applying the sampling strategy.


#### `result_validations`

```python
result_validations(self) -> list[tuple[Requirement, ValidationResult]]
```

The validation results associated with the final output or result from applying the sampling strategy.


### `SamplingStrategy`


A SamplingStrategy class defines an abstract base class for implementing various sampling strategies.

This class provides a template for creating concrete sampling strategies that can be used to generate model outputs based on given instructions.
It allows setting custom validation and generation functions through properties.


**Methods:**

#### `sample`

```python
sample(self, action: Component, context: Context, backend: Backend, requirements: list[Requirement] | None) -> SamplingResult
```

This method is the abstract method for sampling a given component.

It must be implemented by any concrete subclasses to provide specific sampling logic.

**Args:**
- `action `: The action object to be sampled.
- `context`: The context to be passed to the sampling strategy.
- `backend`: The backend used for generating samples.
- `requirements`: List of requirements to test against (merged with global requirements).
- `validation_ctx`: Optional context to use for validation. If None, validation_ctx = ctx.
- `format`: output format for structured outputs.
- `model_options`: model options to pass to the backend during generation / validation.
- `tool_calls`: True if tool calls should be used during this sampling strategy.

**Returns:**
- A result object indicating the success or failure of the sampling process.
