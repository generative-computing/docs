# `mellea.stdlib.sampling.best_of_n`


Best of N Sampling Strategy.

## Classes

### `BestofNSamplingStrategy`


Sampling strategy that selects the best response from a set of samples as given by a Requirement Scorer.


**Methods:**

#### `sample`

```python
sample(self, action: Component, context: Context, backend: Backend, requirements: list[Requirement] | None) -> SamplingResult
```

This method performs a sampling operation based on the given instruction.

**Args:**
- `action `: The action object to be sampled.
- `context`: The context to be passed to the sampling strategy.
- `backend`: The backend used for generating samples.
- `requirements`: List of requirements to test against (merged with global requirements).
- `validation_ctx`: Optional context to use for validation. If None, validation_ctx = ctx.
- `format`: output format for structured outputs.
- `model_options`: model options to pass to the backend during generation / validation.
- `tool_calls`: True if tool calls should be used during this sampling strategy.
- `show_progress`: if true, a tqdm progress bar is used. Otherwise, messages will still be sent to flog.

**Returns:**
- A result object indicating the success or failure of the sampling process.

**Raises:**
- `AssertionError`: Asserts that all required components (repair, select_from_failure, validate, and generate) are provided before proceeding with the sampling.


#### `select_from_failure`

```python
select_from_failure(sampled_actions: list[Component], sampled_results: list[ModelOutputThunk], sampled_val: list[list[tuple[Requirement, ValidationResult]]]) -> int
```

Selects the attempt with the highest score.

**Args:**
- `sampled_actions`: List of actions that have been executed (without success).
- `sampled_results`: List of (unsuccessful) generation results for these actions.
- `sampled_val`: List of validation results for the results.

**Returns:**
- The index of the result that should be selected as `.value`.


#### `repair`

```python
repair(old_ctx: Context, new_ctx: Context, past_actions: list[Component], past_results: list[ModelOutputThunk], past_val: list[list[tuple[Requirement, ValidationResult]]]) -> tuple[Component, Context]
```

Adds a description of the requirements that failed to a copy of the original instruction.

**Args:**
- `old_ctx`: The context WITHOUT the last action + output.
- `new_ctx`: The context including the last action + output.
- `past_actions`: List of actions that have been executed (without success).
- `past_results`: List of (unsuccessful) generation results for these actions.
- `past_val`: List of validation results for the results.

**Returns:**
- The next action component and context to be used for the next generation attempt.
