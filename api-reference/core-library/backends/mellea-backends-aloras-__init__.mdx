# `mellea.backends.aloras`


Abstract interfaces for Backends that implement Activated LoRAs.

## Classes

### `Alora`


Activated LoRAs (Aloras)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12397) are are [low-rank adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) that can reuse KV cache from their underlying model.

This class should not be directly subclassed by a specific ALora. Each backend that supports ALora should provide a backend-specific abstract class that subclasses `ALora`. Individual ALoras should then be defined by subclassing the model-specific backend.

ALoras are always attached to an underlying model and use the following calling convention:
1. The underlying model is prompted (without the Alora active). We call this the `input`.
2. The underlying model generates some tokens from the `input` context (again, without the ALora active). We call this the `response`.
3. Then the adapter is activated and generates some tokens. We call then the `alora_response`.

**Args:**
- `name`: An arbitrary name/label in the model serving engine (e.g. vllm, or local huggingface) to assign to an ALora. This is irrelevant from the alora's (huggingface) model id.


**Methods:**

#### `generate_using_strings`

```python
generate_using_strings(self, *args, **kwargs) -> ModelOutputThunk
```

Generates from the ALora using raw strings as the interface for inputs. In most cases, must be run from a running event loop.

This has a generic signature because each aLoRA has different parameters depending on its functionality and how it gets called.


#### `generate_using_stdlib`

```python
generate_using_stdlib(self, *args, **kwargs) -> CBlock
```

Generates from the Alora using Span-based backends.


### `AloraBackendMixin`


Mixin class for backends capable of aLoRA functionality.


**Methods:**

#### `add_alora`

```python
add_alora(self, *args, **kwargs)
```

Loads an ALora.


#### `get_alora`

```python
get_alora(self, alora_name: str) -> Alora | None
```

Returns the ALora by name, or None of that ALora isn't loaded.


#### `get_aloras`

```python
get_aloras(self) -> list[Alora]
```

Returns a list of all loaded aLoRA adapters.
