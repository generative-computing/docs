# `mellea.backends.types`


Useful type definitions for models, formatters, and backends.

## Classes

### `ModelOption`


A type that wraps around model options.

Uses sentinel values (wrapped by @@@) to provide backend and model-agnostic keys for common model options.

Create a dictionary containing model options like this:

from mellea.backends.types import ModelOption
model_options = { ModelOption.TEMPERATURE : 0.0, ModelOption.SYSTEM_PROMPT : "You are a helpful assistant" }


**Methods:**

#### `replace_keys`

```python
replace_keys(options: dict, from_to: dict[str, str]) -> dict[str, Any]
```

Returns a new dict with the keys in `options` replaced with the corresponding value for that key in `from_to`.

* Any key with value == None is treated the same as the key missing.

* If the destination key already exists in `options`, the original value is kept in the output.

* Regardless of the presence of the destination key in `options`,
  the source key is always absent in the output.

Example:
```python
>>> options = {"k1": "v1", "k2": "v2", "M1": "m1"}
>>> from_to = {"k1": "M1", "k2": "M2"}

>>> new_options = replace_keys(options, from_to)
>>> print(new_options)
... {"M1": "m1", "M2": "v2"}
```

* Notice that "M1" keeps the original value "m1", rather than "v1".
* Notice that both "k1" and "k2" are absent in the output.


#### `remove_special_keys`

```python
remove_special_keys(model_options) -> dict[str, Any]
```

Removes all sentiel-valued keys (i.e., those that start with @@@).


#### `merge_model_options`

```python
merge_model_options(persistent_opts: dict[str, Any], overwrite_opts: dict[str, Any] | None) -> dict[str, Any]
```

Creates a new dict that contains all keys and values from persistent opts and overwrite opts. If there are duplicate keys, overwrite opts key value pairs will be used.
